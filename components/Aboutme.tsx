        I’m a BS Information Technology graduate with hands-on experience in WordPress, Shopify, basic programming, and IT support. While I have no formal work experience, I’ve built real skills through academic projects and a paid internship. I’m a fast learner, detail-oriented, and passionate about using technology to solve problems. I’m eager to grow, contribute to real projects, and bring value to any team I join.
